abstract = {ABSTRACT Research in experimental psychology suggests that, in violation of Bayes' rule, most people tend to “overreact” to unexpected and dramatic news events. This study of market efficiency investigates whether such behavior affects stock prices. The empirical evidence, based on CRSP monthly return data, is consistent with the overreaction hypothesis. Substantial weak form market inefficiencies are discovered. The results also shed new light on the January returns earned by prior “winners” and “losers.” Portfolios of losers experience exceptionally large January returns as late as five years after portfolio formation.},

abstract = {SUMMARY We introduce the weighted likelihood bootstrap (WLB) as a way to simulate approximately from a posterior distribution. This method is often easy to implement, requiring only an algorithm for calculating the maximum likelihood estimator, such as iteratively reweighted least squares. In the generic weighting scheme, the WLB is first order correct under quite general conditions. Inaccuracies can be removed by using the WLB as a source of samples in the sampling-importance resampling (SIR) algorithm, which also allows incorporation of particular prior information. The SIR-adjusted WLB can be a competitive alternative to other integration methods in certain models. Asymptotic expansions elucidate the second-order properties of the WLB, which is a generalization of Rubin's Bayesian bootstrap. The calculation of approximate Bayes factors for model comparison is also considered. We note that, given a sample simulated from the posterior distribution, the required marginal likelihood may be simulation consistently estimated by the harmonic mean of the associated likelihood values; a modification of this estimator that avoids instability is also noted. These methods provide simple ways of calculating approximate Bayes factors and posterior model probabilities for a very wide class of models.},

These estimators make use of the output of auxiliary mixture sampling for count data and for binary and multinomial data.

These estimators are applied to a logit regression model, to a Poisson regression model, to a binomial model with random intercept, as well as to state space modeling of count data.}

Economically, periods in which connectedness is created at high frequencies are periods when stock markets seem to process information rapidly and calmly, and a shock to one asset in the system will have an impact mainly in the short term. When the connectedness is created at lower frequencies, it suggests that shocks are persistent and are being transmitted for longer periods.}",

Using data covering most liquid U.S. stocks in seven sectors, we provide ample evidence of the asymmetric connectedness of stocks at the disaggregate level. Moreover, the spillovers of bad and good volatility are transmitted at different magnitudes that sizably change over time in different sectors. While negative spillovers are often of substantial magnitudes, they do not strictly dominate positive spillovers. We find that the overall intra-market connectedness of U.S. stocks increased substantially during the recent financial crisis.}

We show that despite significant volatility fluctuations in all four markets during the sample, cross-market volatility spillovers were quite limited until the global financial crisis, which began in 2007. As the crisis intensified, so too did the volatility spillovers, with particularly important spillovers from the stock market to other markets taking place after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers in September 2008.}

These include measures of inflation persistence, the natural rate of unemployment, a core rate of inflation, and ‘activism coefficients’ for monetary policy rules. Our posteriors imply substantial variation of all of these objects for post WWII US data. After adjusting for changes in volatility, persistence of inflation increases during the 1970s, then falls in the 1980s and 1990s. Innovation variances change systematically, being substantially larger in the late 1970s than during other times. Measures of uncertainty about core inflation and the degree of persistence covary positively. We use our posterior distributions to evaluate the power of several tests that have been used to test the null hypothesis of time-invariance of autoregressive coefficients of VARs against the alternative of time-varying coefficients. Except for one, we find that those tests have low power against the form of time variation captured by our model.}

abstract = {Behavioral finance studies reveal that investor sentiment affects investment decisions and may therefore affect stock pricing. This paper examines whether the geographic proximity of information disseminated by the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak events combined with intense media coverage affected stock prices in the U.S. We find that the Ebola outbreak event effect is the strongest for the stocks of companies with exposure of their operations to the West African countries (WAC) and the U.S. and for the events located in the WAC and the U.S. This result suggests that the information about Ebola outbreak events is more relevant for companies that are geographically closer to both the birthplace of the Ebola outbreak events and the financial markets. The results also show that the effect is more pronounced for small and more volatile stocks, stocks of specific industry, and for the stocks exposed to the intense media coverage. The event effect is also followed by the elevated perceived risk; that is, the implied volatility increases after the Ebola outbreak events.}

Testing for linear and nonlinear Granger causality in the stock price-volume relation. Journal of Finance 49, 1639–1664]. After illustrating the problem by showing that rejection probabilities under the null hypothesis may tend to one as the sample size increases, we study the reason behind this phenomenon analytically. It turns out that the Hiemstra–Jones test for the null of Granger non-causality, which can be rephrased in terms of conditional independence of two vectors X and Z given a third vector Y, is sensitive to variations in the conditional distributions of X and Z that may be present under the null. To overcome this problem we replace the global test statistic by an average of local conditional dependence measures. By letting the bandwidth tend to zero at appropriate rates, the variations in the conditional distributions are accounted for automatically. Based on asymptotic theory we formulate practical guidelines for choosing the bandwidth depending on the sample size. We conclude with an application to historical returns and trading volumes of the Standard and Poor's index which indicates that the evidence for volume Granger-causing returns is weaker than suggested by the Hiemstra–Jones test.}

The model we develop assumes that regime durations have a Poisson distribution. It approximately nests the two most common approaches: the time-varying parameter (TVP) model with a change-point every period and the change-point model with a small number of regimes. We focus considerable attention on the construction of reasonable hierarchical priors both for regime durations and for the parameters that characterize each regime. A Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior sampler is constructed to estimate a version of our model, which allows for change in conditional means and variances. We show how real-time forecasting can be done in an efficient manner using sequential importance sampling. Our techniques are found to work well in an empirical exercise involving U.S. GDP growth and inflation. Empirical results suggest that the number of change-points is larger than previously estimated in these series and the implied model is similar to a TVP (with stochastic volatility) model.}",

This approach is compared with several alternative methods using real data. The paper also develops simulation-based methods for filtering, likelihood evaluation and model failure diagnostics.

The main existing approaches treat all change-points equally, a priori, using either a Uniform prior or an informative hierarchical prior. Both approaches assume a known number of change-points. Some undesirable properties of these approaches are discussed. We develop a new Uniform prior that allows some of the change-points to occur out of sample. This prior has desirable properties, can be interpreted as “noninformative,” and treats the number of change-points as unknown. Artificial and real data exercises show how these different priors can have a substantial impact on estimation and prediction.},

abstract = {Uncertainty appears to jump up after major shocks like the Cuban Missile crisis, the assassination of JFK, the OPEC I oil-price shock, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time-varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using firm-level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital adjustment costs (both convex and nonconvex). Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias, while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.},

The monthly index of Chinese and US EPU and RV are used to analyze the pairwise directional spillovers. We find that RV is a net receiver that is more vulnerable to shocks from U.S. EPU than to shocks from Chinese EPU. We further decompose the RV into good and bad volatility to test the asymmetric spillover effect between the stock market and EPU. The results suggest that EPU has a bigger effect on bad volatility in the stock market throughout most of the sample period. However, we find that good volatility spillovers become larger during periods of stimulated reform, whereas bad volatility spillovers become larger during periods of international disputes. We show that Chinese stock market volatility is sensitive to both U.S. and Chinese EPU and that the spillover is asymmetric in different periods.}

abstract = {A method is presented for simultaneously estimating a system of nonparametric regressions which may seem unrelated, but where the errors are potentially correlated between equations. We show that the advantage of estimating such a ‘seemingly unrelated’ system of nonparametric regressions is that less observations can be required to obtain reliable function estimates than if each of the regression equations is estimated separately and the correlation ignored. This increase in efficiency is investigated empirically using both simulated and real data. The method uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework where each regression function is represented as a linear combination of a large number of basis terms. All the regression coefficients, and the variance matrix of the errors, are estimated simultaneously by their posterior means. The computation is carried out using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme that employs a ‘focused sampling’ step to combat the high-dimensional representation of the unknown regression functions. The methodology extends easily to other nonparametric multivariate regression models.}

Journal of Econometrics 74, 119–147] we propose the `generalized' impulse response analysis for unrestricted vector autoregressive (VAR) and cointegrated VAR models. Unlike the traditional impulse response analysis, our approach does not require orthogonalization of shocks and is invariant to the ordering of the variables in the VAR. The approach is also used in the construction of order-invariant forecast error variance decompositions.}

However, investors’ monitoring is disproportionately focused on large firms and firms with meetings outside the busy spring proxy season. Using an instrumental variables approach that isolates the drop in governance attention during the busy proxy season, we show that governance research is related to investors’ monitoring of firms, through voice and exit. Moreover, governance research disciplines management, who, as a result, reduce investments and increase payouts. The concentration of attention results in joint monitoring of a relatively small subset of firms.}",

  abstract={The degree of interdependences among holdings of financial sectors and its varying patterns play important roles in forming systemic risks within a financial system. In this article, we propose a VAR model of conditional quantiles with functional coefficients to construct a novel class of dynamic network system, of which the interdependences among tail risks such as Value-at-Risk are allowed to vary with a variable of general economy. Methodologically, we develop an easy-to-implement two-stage procedure to estimate functionals in the dynamic network system by the local linear smoothing technique. We establish the consistency and the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under time series settings. The simulation studies are conducted to show that our new methods work fairly well. The potential of the proposed estimation procedures is demonstrated by an empirical study of constructing and estimating a new type of dynamic financial network.},
